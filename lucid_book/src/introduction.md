## Quality Of Life Changes
Since the primary focus of this hack are trainer battles, a lot of qol changes were made to remove distractions and streamline the gameplay.
  * Porta-PC
  * Poke Vial
  * Poke Rider (replacement for HM Fly)
  * HMs have been replaced by story check points (noteable: surfing is unlocked after badge 5)
  * Permanent Repel
  * Level Cap candy (levels up to the level cap)
  * Easy access to many tutor moves
  * Pre-damaging and pre-statusing in party menu
  * Instant Egg Hatching
  * Infinite money
  * Running shoes can be toggled to be permanent
  * No grinding, levels are increased with the Level Cap Key Item

## Game Modes
The project has 2 modes, a **Normal Mode** and a **Casual Mode**. Both modes have the same trainer battles, but in **Casual Mode** you can build your own adventure. What is meant by your own adventure? In a new game, if the option **Casual Mode** is chosen, access to a newly added house south of Littleroot Town will be granted. This place has a lot of settings to customize the game. That includes choosing a gimmick (Mega, Tera outside the Tera Islands, or Z-Moves) and access to a lot of powerful items. Basically, **Casual Mode** provides the player with many more tools to play the game.

## Randomizer Options
  * Scaled Randomizer
    * The quality of encounters scales with progress made
  * Normal Randomizer
    * Regular randomizer where anything can be encountered
