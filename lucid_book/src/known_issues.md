### Current known issues

  * Battle Engine
    * If both attacker and target have Eject Pack and Eject Button
      * In Lucid the activation is based on speed
      * In vanilla Eject Button always activates before Eject Pack
    * In a 1v2 Multi Battle when the right opponent side has no mons left and 2 mons die at the same time, the left side will sent out a bad egg which can potentially freeze the game
    * Mirror Coat and Counter don't work in double battles (inconsistent)

  * Battle AI
    * Hone Claws is a fake move. The ai never considers it.

  * Trainer Mon
    Ursaluna from Santiago has Bulletproof instead of Guts
