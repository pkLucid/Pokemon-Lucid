### Known Issues

  * Battle Engine
    * If Eject Button ejects into an Intimidate (applies to all abilites that trigger immediately) mon Life Orb / Shell Bell will miss timing
    * In a 1v2 Multi Battle when the right opponent side has no mons left and 2 mons die at the same time, the left side will sent out a bad egg which can potentially freeze the game
    * Mirror Coat and Counter don't work in double battles

  * Battle AI
    * Hone Claws is a fake move. The ai never considers it.
    * Well Baked Body has no ai, so ai will spam fire moves (randomizer)
