### Pokemon Lucid Changelog v1.2.2 (Optional)

* Fixes
  * Potential soft lock in the E4 building. Cause is uknwon and so far only 2 reports. Fixed it by resetting flags once the player enters the building. If you are already there, about to do the E4, please leave and re-enter just in case. 
  * Fixes positive effect inconsitency for Brick Break (it was considered positive effect when AI had screens on field) and Absorb (Wasn't a positive effect if AI had Liquid Ooze, not player)
