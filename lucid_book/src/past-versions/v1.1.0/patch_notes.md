## Note
 * Small balance changes were included in this patch to avoid further patches. They were minor and I don't think any other changes are needed in the forseeable future
 * With the addition of the Tera/Stella Island trainers the game is now finished.
 * Triple Axel is considered a 120BP move when the damage is simulated. Also since each hit is calculated independently
 during actual damage calculation the damage roll could differ from showdown but it is between the 1st and 16th.

## Known issues
 * Rapid spin activates before Toxic Debris
 * AI sees one roll lower for gems boost so the 7th (Might apply to type boosting items so just use the 7th roll)
 * Type indicator in battle for tera is wrong. Just a visual issue
 * Forces of Nature signature moves anim broken (visual only)
