## Move effects:
* Moves with regular move effects generally get a +2/+3 if they apply. If I list some effects and don't specify a score you can assume that this is true
* Some effects get a +1 only in some rare instances. That makes them tied with best damage move
* Moves that target partner get a +10 if conditions apply
* Generally a move that faints the ai will have the highest score. Exceptions are TrickRoom, Protect and Palafin-Zero with Flip Turn.
* If a move would fail if used by AI it will get a -20

## Status Moves
* For the following checks order matters
* If the move would fail the AI wont click it

### Protect (+15 if conditions apply)
* If either mon has encore, no score increase
* If AI is faster then both opposing mons, no score increase
* If AI used protect last turn, no score increase
* If it's the first turn for AI mon on the field and one opposing mon can faint it, 100% score increase
* If not first turn and any opposing mon can faint, 50/50 score increase
* The rules of a double battles still apply. Meaning if AI targets a player mon to kill it, it will not go for protect if the target has no move to faint the AI mon

### Hazards (including Stone Axe / Ceaseless Edge)
* If AI outdamages and player has a way to remove hazards, no score increase
* 70/30 in favor of no hazards if player has a way to remove rocks
